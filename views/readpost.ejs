       var detail = ["I was on a panel recently discussing the future of work when a fellow panelist shared a chilling statistic. In their research, they had monitored the social media platform Discord and found a server with approximately 5,000 children actively and openly discussing suicide.  These conversations were unfolding in a digital space with virtually no adult supervision ing against the backdrop of a well-documented youth mental med with obsolete knowledge and a broken compass pointed toward a future that no longer exists.  The Anti-Wnd a healthy work-life balance — things the current system seems ill-equipped to provide.never could.  Finally, we need to teach adaptability and lifelong learning. The idea of learning a single trade for life is dead. Education must instill a “growth mindset,” teaching students how to learn, unlearn, and relearn continuously. Achieving that goal requires embracing new, personalized learning technologies and creating a system that supports individuals throughout their entire careers, not just for the first 18 years.  Wrapping Up The image of thousands of children lost in a digital world of despair is a stark reflection of our collective failure. We are standing by as a generation grows up unsupervised online and unprepared for the profound economic and social shifts that AI will bring.  That crisis is not a problem that technology can solve; it is a human problem that requires a human solution. It demands that parents reassert their role as guides in both the real and digital worlds. It requires that our education system shed its industrial-age skin and transform to cultivate the skills that will matter most in the coming century.  If we fail to act, we risk a future defined not by the incredible promise of AI, but by the lost potential of a generation we left behind.  Tech Product of the Week  Google’s Pixel 10 Pro Fold The AI-Powered Hybrid We’ve Been Waiting For Pixel 10 Pro Fold  The Pixel 10 Pro Fold combines large dual screens with AI-powered features. (Image Credit: Google)  Speaking as someone who has used and loved the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold for the last year, the bar for its successor was incredibly high. Yet, after its reveal last week, the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold has cleared that bar with room to spare, cementing its place as this week’s standout product.  This phone isn’t just an iterative update; it’s a confident stride forward that perfects the phone/tablet hybrid, wrapping bleeding-edge AI and photography into a stunningly refined package.  The Pixel 10 Pro Fold solidifies its position as the best hybrid device on the market by focusing on what matters: the screens. With a larger 6.4-inch outer display and a sprawling 8-inch internal screen, it functions perfectly as a premium smartphone when closed and a powerful, multitasking tablet when open. This duality is its superpower, offering a level of versatility that a standard slab phone simply can’t match.  Under the hood, the new Tensor G5 chip unlocks a suite of AI features that feel like magic. New tools like “Camera Coach” provide real-time suggestions to improve your photo composition, while “Magic Cue” proactively surfaces information from your apps when you need it. The photography hardware gets a boost with a new 48MP main sensor, but it’s the AI-driven software like “Instant View” — which uses the large screen to show a preview gallery as you shoot — that truly elevates the experience.   This year’s launch event in New York was the most Apple-like yet — a polished, confident presentation that showcased not just a phone but an entire ecosystem. From the new Pixel Watch 4 (I wear the 3) to the Pixelsnap magnetic charging accessories that echo Apple’s MagSafe, Google presented a cohesive vision of hardware and software working in perfect harmony.  This polish addresses one of the few remaining hardware gaps, leaving the core reasons users prefer Pixel phones over their Apple alternatives shining brighter than ever. It comes down to the software experience and intelligent assistance. The clean, bloatware-free version of Android, combined with the deep integration of a beneficial AI like Gemini, offers a level of customization and proactive help that iOS can’t match.  For users who value a smarter, more personalized device that works for them, the Pixel remains the undisputed champion. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the ultimate expression of that philosophy and my Product of the Week.", "fostering ongoing collaboration between Kazakhstan and global academic institutions.

From the early Snapdragon mobile processors that defined the Android flagship experience to the AI-driven, 5G-capable platforms of today, the company has consistently balanced performance, power efficiency, and connectivity in ways that shape entire product categories.  The latest announcement of the Snapdragon W5+ Gen 2 and W5 Gen 2 platforms signals Qualcomm’s determination to bring that same formula to wearables — a segment still struggling to reach the mass market beyond a few high-profile successes like the Apple Watch.  This launch marks more than just a generational upgrade. It’s an effort to address some of the foundational barriers that have kept wearables from reaching their full potential.  John Kehrli, Qualcomm’s Senior Director of Product Management for wearables, framed the move as the culmination of years of incremental learning. “With W5+ Gen 2, we’re taking what we’ve mastered in smartphones — integrating performance, efficiency, and connectivity into one seamless platform — and bringing it to a category that’s still searching for its defining moment,” he said.  Qualcomm SoC Expertise Targets Wearables Qualcomm’s DNA is rooted in complex SoC integration. The company’s engineers understand that the magic of a great device is not in maxing out any single component, but in orchestrating CPU, GPU, connectivity, AI, and power management into a tightly optimized whole. That’s what W5+ Gen 2 and W5 Gen 2 aim to deliver.  Qualcomm Snapdragon W5+ Gen 2 and W5 Gen 2 wearable platforms with NB-NTN satellite, machine learning GPS, and RF front end.  Qualcomm’s Snapdragon W5+ Gen 2 and W5 Gen 2 introduce NB-NTN satellite connectivity, machine learning GPS accuracy, and an optimized RF front end for next-generation wearables. (Image Credit: Qualcomm)  The chips are built on a 4nm process, offering higher performance per watt and enabling OEMs to shrink form factors without sacrificing capability. The addition of Location Machine Learning 3.0 improves GPS accuracy by up to 50% in dense urban environments — a critical feature for runners, cyclists, and anyone using a smartwatch in cities or rugged terrain.  The optimized RF front end contributes to an approximately 20% smaller footprint and lower power consumption, giving manufacturers more flexibility in design.  The headline feature, however, is NB-NTN satellite support — a first for the wearable industry. This technology, powered by Qualcomm’s partnership with Skylo, allows for two-way emergency messaging without cellular or Wi-Fi coverage.", "I was recently pondering how higher education will adjust to the impending demographic cliff that begins in spring 2026 due to the massive drop in birth rate that started with the 2008 financial recession. Will more colleges close and more lay-offs at universities occur? But then I remembered that higher education history has revealed that the two longest-lasting institutions in the United States are 1) the church, and 2) the university. In spite of the focus on the immense wealth of Fortune 500 companies, 89% of them have gone extinct since 1955. Very few of them last anywhere near as long as the resilient higher education system. In fact, in just the past 20 years, 52% of Fortune 500 companies have gone extinct. It suddenly occurred to me that higher education has faced many paradigm shifts in target audiences over the past 150 years, and yet every time universities (at least most of them) have figured out how to adapt and survive. If we ask why this might be, I suggest that the emotional connection made between churches-colleges and their ‘people’ is what matters most. In other words, there are often intense emotions linked to college (and church) experiences, and this type of influence leads people to want to pay, if not even donate, money to allow others to experience similar transformative opportunities. A history of shifting demographics My primary point, however, is that universities figure out ways to survive, if not thrive. We can see that this first happened in the 1800s when the United States developed a standardised educational system through high school. Previously, colleges had focused on attracting boys in what we now consider to be their high school years. However, once this shift occurred, colleges intentionally shifted to admit males who had graduated from high school. The next major target population shift occurred in the late 1800s. Up until then, most colleges were either all-male or all-female. The 1862 Morrill Act led to the creation of land-grant colleges focused on more ‘practical’ professions (agriculture, teaching, mechanical roles, home economics, and engineering). After World War II, higher education capitalised on another demographic shift when eight million of the 16 million veterans of World War II decided to take advantage of the 1944 Servicemen’s Readjustment Act (colloquially known as the GI Bill). This shift opened the doors of colleges to men (and women) of lower socioeconomic status, which began the great democratisation of higher education. The more complete democratisation of higher education started in the 1950s and 1960s when the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court case of 1954 and the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 opened the doors of all colleges to African Americans. Before this, Historically Black Colleges and Universities were the primary vehicle for educating African-Americans in the Southern US. The United States’ internationalisation of higher education began to expand in the 1980s when the birth rate dropped after the Baby Boomers’ bump and state governments reduced higher education funding. Colleges realised that they could maximise tuition revenue by opening their doors to students from other nations, who were not eligible for federal financial aid, so would pay more than 2.5 times what US students would, and were attracted to the prestige of US colleges. The next major shift in higher education students occurred with the advent of the internet in the 1990s. Before this, in order to go to college, students had to travel to the physical campus where they could meet with faculty and fellow students. Once universities noticed in the 2010s that the University of Phoenix and Liberty University were educating more than 100,000 studearning. I want us to think about the emerging focus of higher education on adults in their 50s and older for ongoing learning. Were you aware that the National Resource Center for Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes maintains a list of 124 universities offering programmes for adults who are 50+? Did you know that, in 2005, three Harvard professors wrote a white paper, Moving Higher Education to Its Next Stage, that focused on educating people aged 50+ and resulted in the creation of the Harvard Advanced Leadership Initiative? Did you know that in 2014, the Stanford Center of Longevity created the Distinguished Careers Institute, which is focused on people who are 50+? The growth of learning programmes for older adults is at the beginning of what I predict is a massive expansion, and 2026 is the perfect year for colleges to begin redirecting some resources to the creation of these older academies. I recently pitched this concept to the founder and CEO of a company that targets this population for similar learning experiences. As we discussed, many people in their 50s and 60s have finished raising their children and have more time and money to invest in reimagining the last 10 to 25 years of their working lives. Will more colleges besides Harvard, Stanford, and Notre Dame learn how to capitalise on this emerging market and reinvent higher education for its next great population shift?

Now, with the Trump administration's mass layoffs and cuts to scientific research at the National Institutes of Health, that could be about to change. Earlier this month, a proposal leaked showing the Trump administration's draft plan to slash the National Institutes of Health budget. The NIH is the largest biomedical research agency in the world. The administration's proposal would cut more than 40% from its $47 billion budget and consolidate its 27 institutes and centers into just eight, eliminating four. The plan has shaken up the agency and the broader scientific community, since so much medical research depends on NIH funding. It also appears to have the potential to cause young scientists to look abroad to continue their work. 'We may very well see, as a result of what's happened in these dramatic few months, a reverse brain drain, where we start to lose some of our best and brightest young scientists because they think they will have a better chance in another part of the world,'' said Dr. Francis Collins, who left the NIH in February. 'That would be terribly tragic.' Collins spent 32 years at the agency, including 12 as its director. During his time at the agency, he helped mentor many young scientists. He told 60 Minutes the upheaval has already impacted researchers who are just starting their careers, both because funding has been cut for necessary lab supplies and because many universities have stopped taking on new graduate students or postdoctoral fellows. 'This is a generation that we might lose of young talent,' Collins told 60 Minutes correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi. 'They're the ones who are going to make those next breakthroughs for cancer and diabetes and rare diseases, and many of them aren't sure there's a path [in the U.S.] anymore.' Collins said the U.S. has been the destination for medical research for decades, but other countries — including China — are now starting to catch up. China will take advantage of any loss in American momentum, Collins said. China, along with Australia and Europe, has already boosted its recruitment efforts, hoping to capitalize on the potential brain drain from America. In France, a new program called Safe Place for Science within Aix Marseille University has dedicated millions of dollars to entice students from the U.S. And scholars, it seems, are ready to be lured. Three-quarters of American researchers and graduate students who responded to a recent survey in the weekly scientific journal Nature said they're considering leaving the U.S. to work. But programs abroad aren't immune to changes in the U.S. either. Last month, the Trump administration sent a survey to some international agencies and universities around the world that receive U.S. funding from various federal sources. The questionnaire asked researchers whether their projects complied with U.S. government interests, including ending DEI and climate initiatives. Kristin Weinstein, a PhD candidate at the University of Washington, said she thinks the Trump administration's actions are deliberate. 'Scientists are a group of people who are highly educated and who are good at forming community,' Weinstein told 60 Minutes. 'And I think that by defunding scientific research and creating brain drain, that helps to consolidate control and power.' To continue her research on cancer and auto-immunity after graduation, Weinstein and her family are considering moving abroad. So far, she has explored options in Europe and Canada. Weinstein worries America's loss in medical research could lead to other countries' gain — including China. I think that even if you don't have scientists that are specifically going towards China, wherever they're going, they're dispersing,' she said. And so, you're losing a pool of talented individuals in the United States, which is currently the global leader of biomedical research. According to former NIH director Francis Collins, if the U.S. loses its status as the leader in biomedical research, the consequences will be about more than health — they'll also be about economics." ]%>
